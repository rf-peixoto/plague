Modify agents to:

1. After infecting a machine, check for the (hidden) settings file. This should contain the current target and a list of active agents.
2. Use datetime to check the validity of the found data.
3. Communicate with other agents and mutually verify lists of information. If an agent is out of date, modify its configuration.
4. Remove the need for the central C&C panel.
